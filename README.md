##Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

###Introduction
This repository hosts my R code and documentation files for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning data' project.


###Files and Data
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. Within the data, test and training files are available and must be extracted and placed in the working directory.


###Building the code and data set

The script is titled run_analysis.R and merges the test and training data. After merge, labels are added and only columns with mean and standard deviation values are kept. Ultimately, the output of the 5th step is tidy data called averages_data.txt and uploaded in to github. 

### The Code Book
The CodeBook.md file describes the data, variables, and transformations performed to clean up the data per course requirements.
